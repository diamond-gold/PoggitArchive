<p>This plugin adds a vanilla-style fishing system to your PocketMine server. The Fishing Rod works just like in vanilla Minecraft, allowing players to fish normally.</p>
<p>Once the fishing hook lands in water, the fishing process begins. A fish will appear at a random time within a maximum waiting period of 60 seconds. Players must reel in the fish at the right moment to claim their reward!</p>
<p>Note: The Fishing Rod is not intended for PvP and can only be used for fishing.</p>
