<p>This plugin adds vanilla shields and works perfectly the same as vanilla Minecraft.</p>
<p>Hold the shield, in either hand, crouch to activate and uncrouch to deactivate.</p>
<p>The attacker will get knock back when trying to hit a player that is blocking.</p>
<p>The shield gets a short cooldown when swinging the arm.</p>
