<ul>
<li>Now if you interact with your own shop you won't get the Shopkeeper's inventory but the Shopkeeper's info page</li>
<li>Now if the Shopkeeper is an admin shop you will see a barrier instead of a chest to access to the inventory</li>

<li>Added support for Custom Items</li>
<li>The "Cancel item" button in a trade config now will work</li>
<li>Added the <code>/sk rename &lt;OLDNAME&gt; &lt;NEWNAME&gt;</code> command</li>
<li>Now if you interact with a Shopkeeper without config it will die and an error message will be displayed</li>
<li>The Shopkeeper's info page now is more user-friendly with more options like deleting the shopkeeper</li>
<li>From the config the server owner can now decide how many Shopkeeper entites a player can summon (FOR SHOP)</li>

<h2><a id="user-content-bug-fix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bug-fix"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bug fix</h2>

<h2><a id="user-content-breaking-changes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#breaking-changes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Breaking changes</h2>
<p>You should delete the <code>.entities.json</code> because the final format has finally been implemented and is different from v0.8.x</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-features-that-will-be-added-in-v10" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-that-will-be-added-in-v10"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features that will be added in v1.0</h2>
<p>Version v1.0, also known as <strong>Sales &amp; Shops</strong> will be the first stable version of the plugin and will also contain the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade also 2 items instead of 1</li>
<li>Sales for some players</li>
<li>Shop whitelist
Unfortunately, I'm sorry to tell you that I will be leaving on 28/06 for a month-long vacation where I will be unable to update the plugin, so I will just design and better develop the new features and then get to work on v1.0 at the end of this vacation.
I thank you for your understanding.</li>
</ul>
