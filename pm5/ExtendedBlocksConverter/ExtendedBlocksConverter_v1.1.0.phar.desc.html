<p>Converts any PocketMine-MP 3.0 extended blocks into the latest native blocks!</p>
<p>Yes, you heard right, this plugin can convert any leftover extended blocks from PM3 and convert it into the new latest blocks without leaving update blocks behind!</p>
<p>In order for this plugin to work first don't load any chunks that contain old extended blocks before adding this plugin. Once you have added this plugin, load every chunk you wish to convert to the old extended blocks. Easy as that!</p>
