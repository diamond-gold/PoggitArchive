<p>Ever wanted to add Java Editions achievements to your <a href="https://pmmp.io" rel="nofollow">PocketMine-MP</a> server for whatever reason?</p>
<p>Well I got you covered because this plugin adds in some of the Java Editions achievements!</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong>
This type of achievement system has been lost due to time and have been replaced with advancements therefore I created this plugin to preserve the legacy system I and many others grew up with. Achievements were first added to Minecraft Java Edition back in its beta days in 2011, beta v1.5 to be exact. Although the idea was first planned to get released 1 version earlier in beta v1.4 the plan never came to fruition and had to get pushed back to beta v1.5. When v1.0.0 was released 10 more achievements were added to accommodate the newer function/mechanics that was added aswell in v1.0.0. When Mojang released v1.7 in 2013 they updated the system but only changed minor things such as; A new command <em>/achievement</em> so players can add/remove achievements from a player and having per world achievements(Achievements earned in a specific world are kept in that world). Things stayed the same up to 2017 when Mojang released v1.12 they completely removed achievements and replaced achievements with advancements. In this version(v1.12) they also removed the command <em>/achievement</em>. No major updates happened after that and things are the same since 2017-present.</p>
<p><strong>NOT THE FULL HISTORY I JUST COVER THE MAJOR UPDATES THAT OCCURED</strong></p>
<p>This plugin will <strong>never</strong> have a reward system.... Don't open a request/report suggesting this idea because I will close it without giving any responses, Thank You.</p>
<p>Note: Some achievements have been left out due to pmmp limitations such as; Delicious Fish, On A Rail, Monster Hunter, Cow Tipper, When Pigs Fly, Sniper Duel, Into The Nether, Return to Sender, Into Fire, Local Brewery, The End?, The End, Adventuring Time, The Beginning?, The Beginning. and The Beaconator.</p>
<p><strong>I will add more legacy achievements once pmmp adds new features.</strong></p>
