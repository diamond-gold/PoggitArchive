<p>🔜 <a href="https://github.com/xrde4/XGameMode/assets/111656745/b94c7986-e413-42d5-95eb-96890b4c7de8">Watch the video for functionality</a></p>
<p><br> ✔️ It saves the inventory for each mode, preventing players from accumulating items in creative mode and then switching.
<br> ✔️ You can use the /gm command for your generous donors, but don't forget about me 🥹.
<br> ✔️ If a player switches modes using some external method, the plugin prevents them from using /gm to switch back, as this could potentially lead to item duplication.
<br> ✔️ Dual Language Support: The XGamemode plugin comes with built-in support for two languages directly from the source code, making it easy to cater to a broader player base with different language preferences.</p>

<p>I'm aware that similar plugins existed in earlier versions, but the removal of Item::jsonDeserialize in PM5 resulted in the incompatibility and decline of those previous plugins. XGameMode employs a slightly different approach, ensuring its relevance in the current environment and hopefully in future updates as well. (Stay strong, and best of luck with your efforts!)
