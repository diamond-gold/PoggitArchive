I excited to introduce a new feature that enhances how you manage player behavior. In latest update, you can now choose not to kick players but add a customizable symbol or text to their nickname, ensuring a more inclusive server atmosphere.

Additionally, i implemented a notification system. When a player with a potentially problematic nickname joins, all players receive a notification, enabling proactive community actions.
