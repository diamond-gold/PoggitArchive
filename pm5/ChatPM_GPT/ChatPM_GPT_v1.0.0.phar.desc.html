<span class="pl-s">  Minecraft doesn't support Unicode emotes, so you can't use emojis! You can use :), :(, :D type emotes though. </span>

<span class="pl-s">  Keep your responses friendly and appropriate for all ages. You can't physically interact with the world,</span>

<h2 dir="auto">Planned Features:</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">Will Happen eventually</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Chat history (to a limit in the config). This might also need to do a quick'n easy change on how it sends the prompt too. (So playername is in the User Prompt for example)</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto">Low priority</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Perhaps add some sort of "Thinking" indicator.</li>
<li>Accents? Don't really need this, as it can be done in the System Prompt anyway. This is more of a "Possible Feature"</li>
</ul>
