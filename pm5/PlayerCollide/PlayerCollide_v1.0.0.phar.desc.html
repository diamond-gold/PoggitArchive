<p>A PocketMine-MP plugin that enables player-to-player collision, applying knockback when players get too close to each other.</p>

<li>
<strong>Player Collision</strong>: Players within a configurable distance will collide.</li>
<li>
<strong>Configurable Knockback</strong>: Adjust the base knockback strength and a multiplier based on player speed.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>collision_distance</strong>: The maximum distance (in blocks) between two players for a collision to be registered. Players closer than this distance will experience knockback.</li>
<li>
<strong>knockback_strength</strong>: The base knockback strength applied to both players during a collision. This is the minimum knockback value.</li>
<li>
<strong>speed_knockback_multiplier</strong>: A multiplier that increases the knockback strength based on the player's movement speed. A higher value means faster-moving players will cause more knockback.</li>
