<h2 dir="auto">Description</h2>
<p dir="auto">MuteAll is a simple plugin that allows you to mute all players on the server. This plugin is very useful for when you are doing an event and you don't want players to chat.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have any problems please create an issue I will try to answer them as soon as possible. And feel free to star the project</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, if you are looking for private plugins at a good price, I can make some on my discord: yakuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu_</p>
