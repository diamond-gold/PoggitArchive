<p>BlockPets has a language system so everybody can use the plugin in the language they prefer. You can change language to one of the available languages in the config.yml. Of course, not every language file exists. If you want to help translate, don't hesitate to add a new file and copy the english translations in it, then translate them. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
