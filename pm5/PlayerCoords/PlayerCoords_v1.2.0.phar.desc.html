<p>Ever wanted to know your coordinates whenever you use /coords. Sick of using scoreboards to tell you your coords every 5 seconds. Look no more for you have found, a plugin that is a keeper. This plugin comes with the feature to do /coords whenever you want, and to broadcast it aswell with /bccoords .</p>
