<p>SavedInventoryPlayer is a plugin for PocketMine-MP designed to automatically save and restore player inventories when they leave and rejoin the server. This plugin ensures that all items, including tools, armor, and enchantments, are securely saved and restored without data loss.</p>
<p>This plugin is particularly useful for servers using plugins that remove spaces from player gamertags, such as <a href="https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/taylordevs/NameSpaceRemover/NameSpaceRemover" rel="nofollow">NoNameSpaceRemover</a>, ensuring that player inventories are not lost when they leave and then rejoin the server.</p>
