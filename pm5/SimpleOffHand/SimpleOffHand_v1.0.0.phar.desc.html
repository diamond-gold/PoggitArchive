<p>The "OffHand" plugin is a Minecraft PocketMine-MP plugin that allows players to enable the offhand feature via in-game commands. With this feature, players can move items to the offhand slot while crouching. This feature provides additional flexibility in item management and block placement, similar to the totem mechanic in Minecraft and a feature in Minecraft Java.</p>

<p>Because this is OffHand in PocketMine it is limited to the mechanism that items placed in the OffHand slot cannot function like in Java.</p>
