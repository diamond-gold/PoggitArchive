<p>SoulWell is a PocketMine-MP plugin inspired by Hypixel's Soul Well system, designed to bring an exciting and interactive gacha style experience to Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers. This plugin allows players to open SoulWells using Soul Keys, with each opening granting a random reward. Featuring a sleek modern popup UI and confirmation interaction, SoulWell delivers a polished and immersive ingame experience.</p>
<p>It’s easy to configure and fully customizable, with builtin ScoreHud integration via the {soulwell.soulkey} tag to display each player’s Soul Key count in real-time. The plugin also includes a custom SoulWell chest UI compatible with all devices both Pocket and Windows editions. For those seeking a more classic Hypixel style interface, a resource pack option can be enabled through the config (classic-chest-rp: true), requiring players to download it upon joining the server.</p>
<p>Setting it up is straightforward: admins can mark a SoulWell location using the /addwell command, then break a block where the SoulWell should be placed. Players need at least 10 Soul Keys to interact just punch the SoulWell block, select "Open SoulWell," and enjoy the thrill of receiving a random loot reward. Demo videos from the community, including creators like ZulfahmiFjr, AmlxP Modz シ, FIO, Fredy Ma'ruf, Yusril 9F, and ModdingTwinzツ, offer a closer look at how SoulWell works in-game.</p>
<p>With its robust features and visually appealing design, SoulWell is the perfect addition to any server looking to add a fun, reward based mechanic that keeps players engaged and coming back for more.</p>
