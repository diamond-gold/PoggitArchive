<p>CombatLogger allows you to punish and control players that try to combat log! You can prevent players from executing, specific commands in pvp or even kill them when they attempt to logout while in pvp. You can easily set up CombatLogger on your server by installing a phar and tweaking the settings to your liking! You can edit messages, set the combat timeout time and ban commands from players while they are tagged for pvp.</p>
<br>
<p>
Command banning works by replacing the executed command alias with the registered command name. So if `/f` is an alias of `/faction`, then executing `/f home` in-game would be expanded to `/faction home` for the check so you must write it like this in the settings for it to work.
<br>
Command banning allows you to match any number of subcommands/options. The front of the executed command string will be compared in lowercase against the banned command strings for matches.
