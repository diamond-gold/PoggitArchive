<p>Did you ever miss waterlogging on your server? <br>
Give your blocks all the Hâ‚‚O they deserve</p>

<a id="user-content-features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>
<p>Pretty much like in vanilla, if you want a detailed list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add or remove waterlogging using Buckets</li>
<li>place blocks in water to waterlog them</li>
<li>break waterlogged blocks to free the water</li>
<li>Waterlogged blocks act like normal water sources
<ul>
<li>spreads water to nearby blocks</li>
<li>hardens lava to cobblestone or obsidian</li>
<li>stairs and slabs can be used to restrict waterflow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tripwires and some redstone components can be waterlogged by flowing water, no longer being destroyed</li>
<li>automatic removal of invalid waterlogged blocks (produced by other plugins)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Entity movement caused by flowing water logged blocks is NOT implemented and probably never will.</p>

<p>This plugin uses block layers to store information, while this is the intended storage by mojang, it is only poorly supported by pocketmine.<br>
Removing this plugin will NOT remove waterlogged blocks. They remain saved in your world without any functionality. <br>
A plugin to remove all waterlogged blocks will follow soon.</p>
