<p>Gives a random MOTD shuffle, such as the Minecraft Featured Servers!</p>
<pre><code>Attention:
Due to the way the plugin "CustomAlerts" works, it does not allow MOTDShuffle to work. Please stop sending me issues saying it's not working. Disable "CustomAlerts" first then try again. Then decide which plugin you'd rather have. It's up to you, really!
