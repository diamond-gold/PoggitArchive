<p>This is a notification system working with MySQL and is multi-threaded. The plugin will fetch notifications from the MySQL server, look if they have been displayed and display the notifications to the users. The plugin contains a simple API if you want to create third-party addons. This is a part of the now shut down Pigraid Network System.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/CupidonSauce173/PigNotify">https://github.com/CupidonSauce173/PigNotify</a> for more information about the API and how the plugin works.</p>
