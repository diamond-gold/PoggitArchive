<p>Keep players from dying in the void.  By default, players will be teleported to the spawn point of the world they are in.</p>

<a id="user-content-configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h2>
<p>You can choose whether to save players in specific worlds by using the <code>enabled-worlds</code> and <code>disabled-worlds</code>options in the config.  Players will not be saved from the void in any world in the <code>disabled-worlds</code> group. If any worlds are added to the <code>enabled-worlds</code> group, then any world not listed there will be disabled.</p>
<p>If you would rather have players teleport to the default world spawn instead of the spawn point of the world they are in, you can change the setting for <code>use-default-world</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>
