<li>PocketMine-MP API 4 support.</li>
<li>ScoreFactory v3.1.0.</li>
<li>PHP 8 support.</li>
<li>Integrated BasicScore plugin within ScoreHud.</li>
<li>Major performance improvement as compared to previous versions - thanks in part to ScoreFactory.</li>
<li>ScoreHud can now update a single line on the scoreboard instead of resending the entire board.</li>
<li>No more scoreboard flickering.</li>
<li>Scoreboard is only added once and then only those lines are updated which are changed as compared the previous versions where when there was a single line change the entire board had to be removed and everything had to recalculated and re-sent to the player.</li>
<li>An option in config to switch between single line update or full board update.</li>
