<p>WarpCommand is a simple yet powerful plugin developed for PocketMine versions 4 and 5, allowing users to create and manage custom warps on their server. With this plugin, players can easily set personalized teleportation points that can be accessed later using a simple command.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<p>Custom Warp Creation: Using the "/setwarp " command, players can create custom warps at any location in the game. Upon executing this command, the plugin automatically saves the player's coordinates and current world in the warps.yml file for future use.</p>
<p>Fast Teleportation: After creating a warp, the plugin automatically generates a custom command associated with that warp. For example, if you create a warp called "city", the plugin will create the "/city" command. When this command is executed, the player will be instantly teleported to the corresponding warp's position.</p>
<p>WarpCommand is an essential addition to any PocketMine server as it provides players with the convenience of quickly teleporting to specific locations in the world. With its user-friendly interface and robust management features, this plugin simplifies the creation and usage of custom warps, significantly enhancing the gameplay experience.</p>
