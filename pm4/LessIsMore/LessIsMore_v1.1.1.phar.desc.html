<p>LessIsMore lets you create custom informational commands. This is like /rules plugins, but you can do a lot more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple commands with any name and description</li>
<li>If the command has too many lines of output, they will be separated into different pages</li>
<li>You can change the lines-per-page for each command, or different lines per page (using the "line break" command, see the /more command in the example config)</li>
</ul>
<p>How to setup this plugin? Install it in your server, start the server once, and a config.yml will be created in the plugin_data/LessIsMore/ (<code>plugins/LessIsMore/</code> for old users) folder. There will be examples for different ways of adding commands in the file.</p>
<p>Have fun making commands just for your own server!</p>
