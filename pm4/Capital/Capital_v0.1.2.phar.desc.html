<p>An extensible economy plugin for PocketMine-MP.</p>
<p>Important: To use this plugin, you have to <strong>install <a href="https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/InfoAPI" rel="nofollow">InfoAPI</a></strong> too.</p>

<p>As a core API for economy, Capital supports different styles of account management:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have the old, simple one-account-per-player mechanism.</li>
<li>Or do you like currencies? You can add new currencies to config.yml
and other plugins will let you configure which currency to use in each case.</li>
<li>Or are currencies too complicated for you?
What about just having one account per world?
You don't need any special configuration in other plugins!</li>
<li>Are commands and form UI boring for you?
Maybe use banknote/wallet items
so that players lose money when they drop the item?
(Capital itself does not support banknote/wallet items,
but it is the <em>only</em> economy API where both
simple accounts and item payment can be used from other plugins
without writing code twice)</li>
<li>Or maybe sometimes the money goes to the faction bank account
instead of player account?</li>
<li>Capital is extensible for other plugins to include new account management styles,
And it will work automatically with all plugins!</li>
</ul>
<p>Other cool features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful analytics commands.
How much active capital is there?
How is wealth distributed on the server?
Which industries are the most active?
What are the biggest transactions in the server yesterday?
Capital can help you answer these questions with label-based analytics.</li>
<li>Is editing the config file too confusing for you?
Capital supports self-healing configuration.
Your config file will be automatically regenerated if something is wrong,
and Capital will try its best to guess what you really wanted.</li>
<li>Supports migration from other economy plugins, including:
<ul>
<li>EconomyAPI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uses async database access, supporting both SQLite and MySQL.
Capital will not lag your server.</li>
<li>Safe for multiple servers. Transactions are strictly atomic.
Players cannot duplicate money by joining multiple servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-setting-up" class="anchor" href="#setting-up" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting up</h2>
<p>After running the server with Capital the first time,
Capital generates config.yml and db.yml,
which you can edit to configure Capital.</p>
<p>db.yml is used for configuring the database used by Capital.
You can use sqlite or mysql here.
The configuration is same as most other plugins.</p>
<p>config.yml is a large config that allows you to change almost everything in Capital.
Read the comments in config.yml for more information.
Text after <code>'# xxx:</code> are comments.
If you edit config.yml incorrectly,
Capital will try to fix the config.yml and save the old one as config.yml.old
so that you can refer to it if Capital fixed it incorrectly.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-default-commands" class="anchor" href="#default-commands" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Default commands</h2>
<p>All commands in Capital can be configured in config.yml.
Try searching them in the config file to find out the correct place.
The following commands come from the default config:</p>
<p>Player commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>/pay &lt;player&gt; &lt;amount&gt; [account...]</code>:
Pay money to another player with your own account.</li>
<li>
<code>/checkmoney</code>:
Check your own wealth.</li>
<li>
<code>/richest</code>:
View the richest players on the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Admin commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>addmoney &lt;player&gt; &lt;amount&gt; [account...]</code>:
Add money to a player's account.</li>
<li>
<code>takemoney &lt;player&gt; &lt;amount&gt; [account...]</code>:
Remove money from a player's account.</li>
<li>
<code>/checkmoney &lt;player&gt;</code>:
Check the wealth of another player.</li>
<li>
<code>/capital-migrate</code>:
Import database from EconomyAPI.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>[account...]</code> can be used to select the account (e.g. currency)
if you change the schema in config.yml.
(You can still disable these arguments by setting up <code>selector</code> in config.yml)</p>
<p>You can create many other useful commands by editing config.yml,
e.g. check how much money was paid by <code>/pay</code> command!
Check out the comments in config.yml for more information.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Capital supports different account classifications (known as <a href="#schema">schemas</a>).
All operations involving player accounts require
a config entry to select which account,
e.g. if the user selects the Currency schema,
you need a config that selects which currency to use.
The good news is, you don't have to consider each schema,
because Capital will figure it out.
For each use case, just create an empty config entry to select the account:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml"><pre><span class="pl-ent">selector</span>:</pre></div>
<p>Users can fill this selector with options like <code>allowed-currencies</code> etc.,
depending on the schema they chose.</p>
<p>In <code>onEnable</code>, store this in a class property:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-php"><pre><span class="pl-k">use</span> <span class="pl-v">SOFe</span>\<span class="pl-v">Capital</span>\{<span class="pl-v">Capital</span>, <span class="pl-v">CapitalException</span>, <span class="pl-v">LabelSet</span>};

<span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">Main</span> <span class="pl-k">extends</span> <span class="pl-v">PluginBase</span> {
  <span class="pl-k">private</span> <span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>selector</span>;

  <span class="pl-k">protected</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> <span class="pl-en">onEnable</span>() : <span class="pl-smi">void</span> {
    <span class="pl-v">Capital</span>::<span class="pl-en">api</span>(<span class="pl-s">"0.1.0"</span>, <span class="pl-k">function</span>(<span class="pl-smi">Capital</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>api</span>) {
      <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span><span class="pl-smi">this</span></span>-&gt;<span class="pl-c1">selector</span> = <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>api</span>-&gt;<span class="pl-en">completeConfig</span>(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span><span class="pl-smi">this</span></span>-&gt;<span class="pl-en">getConfig</span>()-&gt;<span class="pl-en">get</span>(<span class="pl-s">"selector"</span>));
    });
  }
}</pre></div>
<p>Then you can use the stored selector in the code
where you want to manipulate player money.</p>

<p>Let's make a plugin called "ChatFee"
which charges the player $5 for every chat message:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-php"><pre><span class="pl-k">public</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> <span class="pl-en">onChat</span>(<span class="pl-smi">PlayerChatEvent</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>event</span>) : <span class="pl-smi">void</span> {
  <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>player</span> = <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>event</span>-&gt;<span class="pl-en">getPlayer</span>();

  <span class="pl-v">Capital</span>::<span class="pl-en">api</span>(<span class="pl-s">"0.1.0"</span>, <span class="pl-k">function</span>(<span class="pl-smi">Capital</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>api</span>) <span class="pl-k">use</span>(<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>player</span>) {
      <span class="pl-k">try</span> {
        yield from <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>api</span>-&gt;<span class="pl-en">takeMoney</span>(
          <span class="pl-s">"ChatFee"</span>,
          <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>player</span>,
          <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span><span class="pl-smi">this</span></span>-&gt;<span class="pl-c1">selector</span>,
          <span class="pl-c1">5</span>, 
          <span class="pl-k">new</span> <span class="pl-v">LabelSet</span>([<span class="pl-s">"reason"</span> =&gt; <span class="pl-s">"chatting"</span>]),
        );

        <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>player</span>-&gt;<span class="pl-en">sendMessage</span>(<span class="pl-s">"You lost $5 for chatting"</span>);
      } <span class="pl-k">catch</span>(<span class="pl-smi">CapitalException</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>e</span>) {
        <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>player</span>-&gt;<span class="pl-en">kick</span>(<span class="pl-s">"You don't have money to chat"</span>);
      }
  });
}</pre></div>
<p>The first "ChatFee" is your plugin name
so that server admins can track which plugin gave the money.
Capital will create a system account for your plugin,
and the money will actually go into the ChatFee system account.</p>
<p>The second parameter <code>$player</code> tells Capital which player to take money from.</p>
<p>The third parameter <code>$this-&gt;selector</code> tells Capital which account to take money from,
as we have explained in the previous section.
Note: if you have multiple different scenarios of giving/taking money,
consider using different selectors.</p>
<p>The fourth parameter <code>5</code> is the amount of money to take.
This value must be an integer.</p>
<p>The last parameter <code>new LabelSet(["reason" =&gt; "chatting"])</code>
provides the labels for the transaction.
Server admins can use these labels to perform analytics.
You may want to let users configure these labels in the config too.</p>
<p>The try-catch block lets you handle the scenario where
player does not have enough money to be taken.
However, remember that <strong>you cannot cancel <code>$event</code> after the first <code>yield</code></strong>,
because transactions are asynchronous, which means that
the event already happened by that time and it is too late to cancel.</p>

<p>Giving money is similar to taking money,
except <code>takeMoney</code> becomes <code>addMoney</code>.
Let's make a plugin called "HitReward" that
gives the player money when they attack someone:</p>

you have to use <code>payUnequal</code> instead.

<p>If you want to check whether the player has enough money for something,
use <code>takeMoney</code> as explained above and handle the error case.</p>
<p>If you just want to display player money, use InfoAPI.
The default config registered the <code>{money}</code> info on players,
but users can change this based on their config setup.
Consider using InfoAPI to compute the messages
and let the user set their own messages.
See <a href="https://github.com/SOF3/InfoAPI">InfoAPI readme</a> for usage guide.</p>
<h1>
<a id="user-content-advanced-api" class="anchor" href="#advanced-api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced API</h1>
<p>The advanced API is for advanced developers
who want to use the specific features in Capital
in addition to the basic money manipulation operations.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-async-functions" class="anchor" href="#async-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Async functions</h2>
<p>Capital uses <a href="https://github.com/SOF3/await-generator">await-generator</a>,
which enables asynchronous programming using generators.
Functions that return <code>Generator&lt;mixed, mixed, mixed, T&gt;</code>
are async functions that return values of type <code>T</code>.
There is a special phpstan-level type alias <code>VoidPromise</code>,
which is just shorthand for <code>Generator&lt;mixed, mixed, mixed, void&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Generator functions must always be called with <code>yield from</code> instead of <code>yield</code>.
Functions that delegate to another generator function MUST always
<code>return yield from delegate_function();</code>,
even though <code>return delegate_function();</code> and
<code>return yield delegate_function();</code> have similar semantics.
This is to ensure consistent behavior where
async functions only start executing when passed to the await-generator runtime.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-module-system-and-dependency-injection" class="anchor" href="#module-system-and-dependency-injection" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Module system and dependency injection</h2>
<p>Capital is module-based.
Every module containing a <code>Mod</code> class is a module.
Each module has its independent semantic versioning line,
as indicated by the <code>API_VERSION</code> constant.
The <code>Mod</code> class is responsible for starting and stopping
components that cannot wait to be initialized only on-demand,
such as commands, event handlers and InfoAPI infos/fallbacks.</p>
<p>Classes that only have one useful instance in the runtime are called "singletons".
To facilitate unit testing in the future,
singletons do not use the traditional <code>getInstance()</code> style.
Instead, all singletons are managed by the <code>Di</code> namespace.
If a (singleton or non-singleton) class requires an instance of a singleton class,
it can implement the <code>Di\FromContext</code> interface and use the <code>Di\SingletonArgs</code> trait,
then declare all required classes in the constructor, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-php"><pre><span class="pl-k">use</span> <span class="pl-v">SOFe</span>\<span class="pl-v">Capital</span>\<span class="pl-v">Di</span>;

<span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">Foo</span> <span class="pl-k">implements</span> <span class="pl-v">Di</span>\<span class="pl-v">FromContext</span> {
  <span class="pl-k">use</span> <span class="pl-v">Di</span>\<span class="pl-v">SingletonArgs</span>;

  <span class="pl-k">public</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> __construct(
    <span class="pl-smi">private</span> <span class="pl-v">Bar</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>bar</span>,
    <span class="pl-smi">private</span> <span class="pl-v">Qux</span> <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-c1">$</span>qux</span>,
  )
}</pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, if initialization of the object is async
(e.g. <code>Database\Database</code> initialization requires waiting for table creation queries),
or the developer does not wish to mix initialization logic in the constructor
(it is a bad practice to do anything
other than field initialization and validation in the constructor),
declare <code>public static function fromSingletonArgs</code> in a similar style.
<code>fromSingletonArgs</code> can return either <code>self</code> or <code>Generator&lt;mixed, mixed, mixed, self&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The class can be instantiated with <code>Foo::instantiateFromContext(Di\Context $context)</code>.
Alternatively, if <code>Foo</code> itself is a singleton class,
it can additionally implement <code>Di\Singleton</code> and use the trait <code>Di\SingletonTrait</code>,
then it can be requested from another <code>FromContext</code> class with the same style.</p>
<p>All <code>Mod</code> classes are singleton and use <code>Di\SingletonArgs</code>.
They are required in the <code>Loader\Loader</code> (this is <em>not</em> the main class) singleton,
which is explicitly created from the main class <code>onEnable</code>.</p>

<p>The main class (<code>Plugin\MainClass</code>) is a singleton,
although it is not initialized lazily like other FromContext classes
(since it is the same instance that started loading everything).
Note that, unlike many other plugins,
the main class does not have any functionality by itself.
It serves only to implement the <code>Plugin</code> interface
as required by some PocketMine APIs,
and is generally useless except for registering commands and event handlers.</p>
<p>The <code>Di\Context</code> is also a singleton,
but similar to the main class, it is not initialized lazily.
Other classes can use it to flexibly require new objects that
were not requested in the constructor under special circumstances.</p>
<p>The await-std instance (<code>\SOFe\AwaitStd\AwaitStd</code>) does not implement <code>Di\Singleton</code>,
but it is also special-cased to allow singleton-like usage.</p>
<p>The <code>\Logger</code> interface is not a singleton.
However, <code>FromContext</code> classes can declare a parameter of type <code>\Logger</code>,
then the DI framework will create a new logger for the class.
(This logger is derived from the plugin logger,
but is not equal to the plugin logger itself)</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-config" class="anchor" href="#config" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Config</h2>
<p>Capital implements a self-healing config manager.
Each module has its own <code>Config</code> class to manage module-specific configuration.
In addition to the singleton and FromContext interfaces,
each <code>Config</code> class also implements <code>Config\ConfigInterface</code> and uses <code>Config\ConfigTrait</code>,
implementing a <code>parse</code> method that reads values
from a <code>Config\Parser</code> object into itself.</p>
<p>The first time <code>parse</code> is called, <code>Config\Parser</code> is in non-fail-safe mode,
which means methods like <code>expectString</code> would throw a <code>Config\ConfigException</code>
if the parsed config contains invalid types or data.
Upon catching a <code>Config\ConfigException</code>,
the config framework calls <code>parse</code> on all <code>Config</code> classes again,
this time providing a <code>Config\Parser</code> in fail-safe mode,
which would no longer throw <code>Config\ConfigException</code>.
Instead, the parser will add missing fields (along with documentation)
or replace incorrect fields in the config,
which are saved to the config after all module configs have been parsed.
<code>Config</code> classes can also use the <code>failSafe</code> method in the <code>Config\Parser</code>
to <em>either</em> return a value <em>or</em> throw a <code>Config\ConfigException</code>
depending on the parser mode.
This strategy allows automatic config refactor when the user changes critical settings
like the <a href="#schema">schema</a>, which cascades changes to many other parts in the config.</p>
<p>Due to difficulties with cyclic dependencies,
all <code>Config</code> classes must be separated listed in the <code>Config\Raw::ALL_CONFIG</code> constant.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-database" class="anchor" href="#database" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Database</h2>
<p>Capital uses <a href="https://github.com/poggit/libasynql">libasynql</a> for database connection.
Note that the libasynql DataConnector is exposed in the Database API,
whcih means the SQL definition is part of semantic versioning.
All structural changes are considered as backward-incompatible changes.
The <code>Database</code> class also provides some low-level
(although higher level than raw SQL queries) APIs to access the database.
Other modules should consider using the APIs in the <code>SOFe\Capital\Capital</code> singleton,
which provides more user-friendly and type-safe APIs than the <code>Database</code> class.</p>
<p>Raw queries are written in <a href="resources/mysql">resources/mysql</a>
and <a href="resources/sqlite">resources/sqlite</a>.
There is a slight diversion in MySQL and SQLite queries due to different requirements;
SQLite does not require any synchronization and assumes FIFO query execution.
MySQL assumes there may be multiple servers using the database,
plus external services (such as web servers) that may modify the data arbitrarily.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-labels" class="anchor" href="#labels" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Labels</h2>
<p>The Capital database is gameplay-agnostic.
This means the database design is independent of how accounts are created.
The database module does not know anything about players or currencies or worlds.
Instead, each account is attached with <em>labels</em> (a string-to-string map),
which provide information about the account and enable account searching.</p>
<p>Each player may have zero or more accounts,
determined by the <a href="#schema">schema</a> configured.
Generally speaking, player accounts are identified by the <code>capital/playerUuid</code> label
(or <code>capital/playerName</code> if username display is required);
analytics modules can use this label to identify accounts associated to a player.</p>
<p>Capital aims to provide reproducible transactions.
All account balance changes other than initial account creation
should be performed through a transaction.
In the case of balance change as initiated by an operator
or automatic reward provided by certain gameplay (e.g. kill reward),
a system account (known as an "oracle") should be used as the payer/payee.
Oracles do not have player identification labels like <code>capital/playerUuid</code>,
but they use the <code>capital/oracle</code> to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Other modules/plugins can also define other account types.
As long as they have their own labels that do not collide with existing labels,
they are expected to work smoothly along with other components.</p>
<p>Transactions can also have their own labels.
At the current state, the exact usage of transaction labels is not confirmed yet.
It is expected that transaction labels can be used to analyze economic activity,
such as the amount of capital flow in certain industries.</p>
<p>The database can search accounts and transactions matching a "label selector",
which is an array of label names to values.
Accounts/transactions are matched by a selector if
they have all the labels specified in the selector.
An empty value in a label selector matches all accounts/transactions
with that label name regardless of the value.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-schema" class="anchor" href="#schema" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schema</h2>
<p>A schema abstracts the concept of labels
by expressing them in more user-friendly terminology.
A schema is responsible for defining the accounts for a player
and parsing config into a specific account selector.</p>
<p>There are currently two builtin schema types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>basic</code>: Each player uses the same account for everything.</li>
<li>
<code>currency</code>: Currencies are defined in schema config,
where each player has one account for each currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other planned schema types, which impose speical challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>world</code>: Each player has one account for each world.
This means accounts must be created lazily and dynamically,
because new worlds may be loaded over time.</li>
<li>
<code>wallet</code>: Accounts are bound to inventory items instead of players.
Players can spend money in an account
when the item associated with the account is in the player's inventory.
This means the player label is mutable and requires real-time updating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's explain how schemas work with a payment command and a currency schema.
The default schema is configured as:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml"><pre><span class="pl-ent">schema</span>:
  <span class="pl-ent">type</span>: <span class="pl-s">currency</span>
  <span class="pl-ent">currencies</span>:
    <span class="pl-ent">coins</span>: <span class="pl-s">{...}</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">gems</span>: <span class="pl-s">{...}</span>
    <span class="pl-ent">tokens</span>: <span class="pl-s">{...}</span></pre></div>
<p>The payment command is configured with a section like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml"><pre><span class="pl-ent">accounts</span>:
  <span class="pl-ent">allowed-currencies</span>: <span class="pl-s">[coins, tokens]</span></pre></div>
<p>This config section is passed to the default schema,
which returns a new <code>Schema</code> object that
only contains the currency subset <code>[coins, tokens]</code>.</p>
<p>When a player runs the payment command (e.g. <code>/pay SOFe 100 coins</code>),
the remaining command arguments (<code>["coins"]</code>)
are passed to the subset schema,
which decides to parse the first argument as the currency name.
Since we only use the subset schema,
only coins and tokens are accepted.
The subset schema returns a final <code>Schema</code> object
that knows <code>coins</code> have been selected.
The sender and recipient are passed to the final <code>Schema</code>,
which returns a label selector for the sender and recipient accounts.
If no eligible accounts are found,
the plugin tries to migrate the accounts
from imported sources as specified by the schema.
If no migration is eligible,
it creates new accounts based on initial setup specified by the schema.</p>

<a id="user-content-analytics" class="anchor" href="#analytics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analytics</h2>
<p>The Analytics module consists of two parts: Single and Top.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-single-metrics" class="anchor" href="#single-metrics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single metrics</h2>
<p><code>Analytics\Single</code> computes single-value metrics.</p>
<p>The <code>Analytics\Single\Query</code> interface abstracts different metric types
parameterized by a generic parameter <code>P</code>.
Use <code>CachedValue::loop</code> to spawn a refresh loop that fetches the latest metric value.
If <code>P</code> is <code>Player</code>, use <code>PlayerInfoUpdater::registerListener()</code>
to automatically spawn refresh loops for online players.</p>
<h2>
<a id="user-content-top-metrics" class="anchor" href="#top-metrics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Top metrics</h2>
<p><code>Analytics\Top</code> reports server-wide top metrics.</p>
<p>Due to the label-oriented mechanism,
it is not possible to efficiently fetch the top accounts directly
because the SQL database cannot be indexed by a specific label.
To allow efficient top metric queries,
the metric is first computed for each grouping label value
(usually the player UUID) and cached in the <code>capital_analytics_top_cache</code> table.</p>
<p>A top metric query is defined by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aggregator to use.
This also defines whether the query operates on accounts or transactions.
Currently all aggregators are accounts-only or transactions-only,
but there will be aggregators on transactions for each account in the future.</li>
<li>The label selector that filters rows.
For example, if the aggregator is about number of transactions of each player,
the label selector filters away non-player accounts
(it is not a transaction label selector).</li>
<li>The grouping label name, where its values will be used to group rows.
For queries on top players, this is <code>AccountLabels::PLAYER_UUID</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three values uniquely identify a top query for computation cache.
These values are md5-hashed into the <code>capital_analytics_top_cache.query</code> column,
which are reused on multiple servers.
The computation takes place in batches, updating a subset of label values each time.
Call <code>Analytics\Top\Mod::runRefreshLoop()</code> to start a refreshing loop.</p>
<p><code>Analytics\Top\DatabaseUtils::fetchTopAnalytics</code> fetches the cached data for display.
For each <code>displayLabels</code> label, a random label value for matching rows
with the name equal to the <code>displayLabels</code> label is returned in the output for display.</p>
