<p>BlockLagFix is a plugin which aims to fix (or atleast reduce to a bare minimum) block lag that can be easily experienced while speed bridging. It reduces the blinking of blocks so it won't be as much noticeable and annoying as before.</p>
<p>Block lagging happens when you try to place blocks too fast consecutive to one on another and that block blinks for a moment. This could be annoying when speed bridging because it can make you fall.</p>
