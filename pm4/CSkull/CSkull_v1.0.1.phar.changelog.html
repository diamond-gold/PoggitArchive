<li>Fixed a server crashing bug that occurred when an entity was flagged twice for despawn. This happened, e.g. when clearing a plot from <a href="https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot">MyPlot</a>. This bug wasn't found during testing, as this plugin was only tested on a server running <a href="https://github.com/ColinHDev/CPlot">CPlot</a>.</li>
