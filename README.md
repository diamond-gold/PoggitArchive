Automated daily archival of plugins on poggit.

Poggit is down again? No problem! Get your plugins from the archives!

Contains every single plugin for PM4 and PM5, as well as all versions of each plugin, along with the changelog and description for each version.

Every phar is downloaded from poggit by GitHub Actions, so you can be sure that the phars are the same as the ones on poggit.
